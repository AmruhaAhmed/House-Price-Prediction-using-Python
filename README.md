# House-Price-Prediction-using-Python

PROBLEM:

House price prediction can help a customer determine the price of a house depending upon the location ,city, area , number of bedrooms and so on. Using machine learning techniques, we can predict the price of a house accurately.

COLUMNS IN THE DATASET:

1.Name-this is the name of the property 

2.Property Title-gives a gist about the number of bedrooms in the house, type of house and so on. 

3.Price-gives the price of that particular property, either in Lakhs or Crores. This is our target column

4.Total_Area-gives the area occupied by the property in sqft

5.Price_Per_SQFT-gives the price per sqft for that property

6.Description-gives a brief summary about the property

7.Baths-gives the number of bathrooms in the house 

8.Location-specifies the locality and city of the property

9.Balcony-specifies whether the house has a balcony or not.

This dataset has been obtained from the public domain.

CONCLUSION: 

The price of the house depending upon the necessary parameters is calculated using this project.This project also gives insights about:

1.how type of house is affecting the price

2.popular localities in each city

3.how BHK/balcony are affecting the price
